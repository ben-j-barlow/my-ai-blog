# AI (para mis amigos): Introducing my new blog!

**A blog created to change Gen Z's perception of artificial intelligence and its applications.**

## Motivation?

While traveling in Latin America during the summer of 2022, I became deeply aware of what I call the **"AI perception gap"**. For 5 weeks, I listened to AI-oriented podcasts by day - on treacherous bus journeys, sea-side sunbeds and rainforest-based hammocks - and socialised in hostel bars by night. From sunrise to sunset, my ears were flooded with hope, optimism, and trust in AI. After dark, however, I was inundated with negativity from backpacker after backpacker - irrespective of nationality. "Do you love Elon Musk?" "When are we all losing our jobs then, mate?" "I'll blame you when the robots take over!" All are exclamations I heard in abundance when I told new friends my plan to pursue an MSc in Artificial Intelligence upon my return.

I honestly could not believe my ears. Educated individuals, from my very generation (not my grandparents!), who were born and raised in wealthy economies where AI is booming, and no one had a clue about the monumental positive impact the technology can and will have on society at a global scale! The perception gap was born...

## Purpose?

Fix the perception gap! I did so on an individual level in hostel bar after hostel bar during my travels. (Surprisingly, this didn’t make me the life of the party!) But with a blog, I can have a much more significant impact!

The overarching aim is to **educate, inspire, and change the perception** of AI. I will highlight use cases of AI that are having a positive impact on society. If all goes to plan, the audience will learn that "AI" does not equate to "self-modifying systems (code-writing code) that are destined to take over the world and kill us all".

## Audience?

For my friends! The blog is for my friends. The translation, of course, acts as a constant reminder of my Latin American experience which inspired the blog. More specifically, "my friends" corresponds to educated individuals (educated to degree level in a different discipline), from all over the world, with ages ranging from 18 to 30.

## What is AI?

AI. I hear it all the time! It's become a buzzword every business seems to throw on its social channels in an attempt to gain traction.

For the purpose of this blog, I will not cross hairs about specific AI sub-fields. Like seemingly every business out there - if there is cool machine learning, data science, deep learning, statistics, or one of many other subfields being used under the hood — I will just call it AI (see appendix for sub-field definitions).

## Enjoy!

Feel free to engage with comments or by reaching out!

In keeping with my Latin American theme, my first blog will discuss a story I learned of whilst reading Judea Pearl's *The Book of Why* on a beanbag in a hostel atrium in San Cristobal, Mexico. Read here how artificial intelligence permitted the rapid return of human remains to their families following a plane shooting above the Russia-Ukraine border in 2014.

## Negative impacts of AI

It must be noted that I am aware that AI has the potential to impact society negatively. Many pro-AI folks are blind to its destructive potential. Of course, risks exist! But, a plethora of risks didn't stop the internet from booming a few decades ago. Adopters of the technology just learned to spot the risks (for example, online scams). I hope we'll do the same as AI becomes more and more prevalent in society.

## Appendix

### AI sub-fields

| Field | Definition | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Machine Learning (ML) | Systems that learn patterns in data, enabling predictions about future data. | Insurance companies predicting the probability of you crashing your car based on your age, make, model, gender, and more. |
| Deep Learning | A subset of machine learning that utilises complicated *artificial neural networks*. | Same as above. |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Focuses on understanding, interpreting, and generating human language. | Translation from one language to another. |
| Computer Vision | Focuses on interpreting and understanding the visual world. | A self-driving car. |
| Reinforcement Learning | A system that learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve a reward. | An AI that plays chess 1000s of times and learns optimal strategies by trial and error. |
| Generative AI | Systems that are capable of creating content (for example, text, images, music). | Deepfakes that can generate realistic but entirely fictional video content. ChatGPT. |

### AI-related fields

| Field | Definition |
|----------|----------|
| Data Science | An interdisciplinary field that aims to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines aspects of statistics, mathematics, and computer science. |
| Statistics | A branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It provides a framework for making inferences about the characteristics or behaviors of groups or phenomena based on a finite set of observations. |

### Other definitions

| Field | Definition |
|----------|----------|
| Artificial Neural network | A computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain work. It aims to spot patterns in data, much like our brain learned to spot patterns in auditory data when we learned to speak as a baby. |
