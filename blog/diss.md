# My MSc Dissertation Project at Stanford University

**Well, that was the coolest professional experience of my life...**

## Intro

From delving into AI and critical minerals research with world-class experts to gatecrashing conferences littered with talent, my three weeks at Stanford were a whirlwind of fun and academic growth. Add in the California sunshine and a road trip in a convertible Mustang, and you've got the recipe for an unforgettable academic adventure.

## Pre-Stanford

How on Earth did I--an AI student at the University of Edinburgh--end up spending the first three weeks of my dissertation working with academics on Stanford University's campus?

It all kicked off with a lightbulb moment a year earlier. There I was, lounging on the sofa, when it hit me: I'd be investing hundreds of hours into a project next summer anyway, so why not aim high? If I could find a company or research group I was extrmely passionate about, I could use my three month project as a trial period for a dream job or PhD, thereby informing my subsequent life decisions.

Fired up by this idea, I dove into research mode. After a week of looking far and wide, I struck gold: Silicon Valley startup KoBold Metals. Their mission to leverage data science for accelerating mineral discoveries had me absolutely captivated.

But the real jackpot? Discovering their academic research partner, Mineral-X at Stanford University, had a team member who'd previously studied in Edinburgh. I knew I'd found my perfect supervisor!

Fast forward through a winter of persistent emails and video calls, and by summer, I'd lined up my a dream dissertation project in a topic that excited me at a world-leading university. A project marrying two fields; applying an AI technique to the domain mineral exploration for the critical battery metals. Determined to squeeze every drop of opportunity from this chance, I self-funded a 3-week trip to California.

## My Time at Stanford

The experience was truly exceptional. AI research lab SISL, who provide AI technical support to Mineral-X, provided a warm welcome, offering me a desk in their office. As a master's student working on only my second ever research project, being surrounded by Stanford PhDs and post-docs was incredibly special.

Having access to world experts in POMDPs (the AI technique I was using) proved invaluable. Their on-demand, in-person guidance significantly accelerated my progress. Beyond the office, they were lovely people too; kindly involving me in weekly ultimate frisbee, taking me to rock up and play soccer games with their friends, and freeing up time to go for coffee/beer to chat in a relaxed setting.

Beyond the academics I worked with directly, I met some incredible people too. During my first week, I was thrilled to discover Mineral-X were hosting their annual symposium during my second week on campus. This gathering brought together industry leaders, heads of data science teams, and recent PhD graduates from around the world, all in one place. The opportunity to engage directly with such a diverse group of experts in my field of interest was truly invaluable.

Besides the professional gains, June in California is somewhat superior to June in Edinburgh. Downtime was spent enjoying rounds at Stanford University Golf Course or supporting the Three Lions in the European Championships at a local English pub. To conclude the trip, I took a two-day Top Gear style drive drifting across both lanes of empty roads with amazing views in a convertible Mustang. I explored San Francisco's bustling streets; crossed the Golden Gate Bridge; snapped pictures of Bay Area views; and rounded it off by drinking a bottle of red from Sonoma Valley in Sonoma Valley itself.

## Reflection

I've ticked off a number of typical achievements in my life: from graduating school with the maximal grade of 3 A*s to being elected by my peers as 1st XI captain of the University of Warwick Men's Football Club. But, sporting and academic achievements had never brought a sense of immense pride. After all, there is always someone outperforming you in academia and I've played alongside teammates far more talented footballers than me.

But, I know no one who had the initative to set up a dissertation project that aligned with their passions with an external supervisor based at a world-leading university they were not enrolled at. This time, my experience was entirely unique, and the sense of pride was striking.
