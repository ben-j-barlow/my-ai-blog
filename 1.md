### Intro

Google’s pioneering AI research lab DeepMind recently solved the ‘protein folding’ problem – a 50-year-old grand challenge in the field of structural biology. They started with 150,000 proteins for which the structure was known, and today, have predicted the structure of over 200 million. Previously, it took a student their entire PhD to determine the structure of a single protein. DeepMind saved the world 4 years multiplied by 199.85 million proteins; nearly 800 million hours of PhD time!* An article’s headline in Forbes read “The Most Important Achievement In AI—Ever” and there is much speculation about their work deserving a Noble Prize.

*Please take this with a pinch of salt. Without AlphaFold, we would have prioritised only a tiny fraction of important proteins rather than determining the structure of 200 million. Nonetheless, the enormous figure highlights the significance of DeepMind’s breakthrough.

### Molecular biology: background

Proteins are essential to life. A familiar example is haemoglobin, a protein which transports oxygen in the blood. They are a sequence of amino acids. DNA becomes RNA. RNA becomes protein. Structure is important due to targeting disease and understanding function.

Proteins are the workhorses of biology and carry out all functions necessary to life. A relatable example from GCSE Biology is haemoglobin – a protein that transports oxygen around the body. Genes in DNA encode proteins and they’re formed by a complicated two step process in which DNA first becomes messenger RNA (mRNA vaccine ring any bells?) and then 

### Molecular biology: protein folding

Average protein is 2000 amino acid bases in a protein. There are 10^300 configurations it could fold, but physics always solves this problem and folds the sequence into one unique solution. Unique mapping of healthy protein. Disease e.g. Alzhimeirs one reason for it is due to protein misfolding.

Since the 1950s, science-y stuff with crystalised proteins, X-ray beams and diffracted light allowed protein structure to be determined. However, researchers spend months or even years crystalising a protein and many important proteins cannot even be crystallised into a usable form. Moreover, painstaking work and expensive electro-microscopes were needed to visualise structure. It took a PhD student their entire PhD to determine the structure of a single protein. AlphaFold does it in seconds.

### Technology

Training set: 150,000. Uncertainty known. High certainty allowed adding to training set.
