# AI (para mis amigos): Identifying Deceased Plane Crash Victims

## The Story Behind The Crash

### Introduction

On July 17, 2014, a Malaysian Airways passenger jet was shot down on its journey from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Kuala Lumpur. The plane was flying through Ukrainian airspace, 50 km from the Russian border, when it was struck by a surface-to-air missile over a region controlled by Russian-backed separatists during the war in Donbas. 298 victims were tragically killed. Identifying and returning body parts to loved ones was a formidable challenge. Remains were heavily burned, thereby degrading DNA, and dispersed over a 50 square kilometer region in an inaccessible, active war zone. Meanwhile, heartborken families across the globe were grieving. Aware that each passing day without a body to bury only added to the immense trauma the deceased's families were experiencing, investigators looked to AI to help with returning unidentified human remains (UHR) to loved ones as quickly as possible.

### The Challenges

Investigators at the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) were tasked with the difficult identifcation process. Frustratingly, they faced a number of obstacles. 

1. **DNA quality**: Fire and explosions during the crash had broken down DNA.
2. **Site accessability**: Due to the ongoing war, site access was limited. Body parts continued to arrive in the Netherlands for 10 months.
3. **Comparison**: The investigators did not have previous records of the victims' DNA, simply because they were not criminals! They were reliant on partial matches with family members.
4. **Volume**: When matching body parts by DNA comparison, the number of necessary comparisons is about the square of the number of body(part)s that need to be identified. 10 victims in a Blue Wing Airlines crash on April 3, 2008 were identified by 100 manual DNA comparisons. This took 2 days by hand. However, investigators at NFI would be forced to make upwards of 90000 comparisons for 298 victims.

The reliance on DNA donations from family members presented additional challenges. The similarity between a family member's and victim's DNA is a function of their relationship. The more distant the relative, the less similar the DNA. Moreover, some victims had many relatives willing to contribute to the investigation, whilst others had limited family contact. The investigators needed an identification framework that offered flexibility in terms of the relative's relationship and number of relatives involved. A

### The Solution

Bonparte! Fortunately for the NFI, they had a state-of-the-art forensic software system - named Bonaparte - designed to facilitate quick human DNA based identification. Developed by a team at Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands, during the mid-2000s, the system has been in production since 2010 and is continuously being updated.

The system was the perfect solution for the investigation. It constructed a pedigree (family) tree for each victim, which when combined with DNA analysis, enabled identification of body parts even in the limited setting of partial DNA matches. Furthermore, the system facilitated DNA donations from multiple family members with great flexibility offered in terms of relationship with the victim. Finally, the digital nature of the system permitted 1000s of DNA comparisons in minutes.

After analysing 6,000+ unidentified human remains (UHR) body fragments and 500+ reference samples from relatives, 294 of the 298 victims had been identified by November, 2014. Another two victims have since been identified, whilst the two others have sadly vanished without a trace. Bonaparte has proven to be an indespensible tool in this type of investigation at the Netherlands Forensic Institute

## The Story Behind The Technology

### Thomas Bayes

Reverend Thomas Bayes (1702 - 1761) was a Presbyterian minister, theologian, and mathematics geek. His fame follows from his work on inverse probability. Consider the sentence: "10 year-old Ben Barlow hit the football towards his grandparents' window and the window smashed." Much to the annoyance of my grandad, who was pleasently enjoying his 70th birthday at the time. After observing the cause (Ben kicks the ball), we can estimate the probability of the effect (the window smashed). Human cognition works in this direction. 

But, given the effect (the window smashed and my grandad spent the afternoon of his birthday boarding up a window whilst all the family went out to celebrate), we need much more information to deduce the cause (who kicked the ball that broke it or even the fact that it was broken by a ball in the first place). Bayes broke this cognitive asymmetry and provided us with the mathematical tools to infer the probability of the cause having observed the effect. This is what we mean by "inverse probability".

### Judea Pearl

Over two centuries later, along came Israeli-American computer scientist and philosopher Judea Pearl. Whilst you may not be familiar with Pearl, you've likely heard the phrase "correlation not cauation". Pearl spent his academic carrer developing the mathematical tools for causal reasoning; we can now make "X causes Y" conclusions rather than being limited to "X correlates with Y". During his academic journey, he invented a mathematical framework called Bayesian networks. They area the popular tool in today's world of machine learning and are the framework underpinning Bonparte.

At the onset of the 1980s, a standstill in advancements had caused the excitement for AI that Turing inspired in the 60s to decline. In the early days, the leading approach to solving problems in the field had been rule-based systems (if A, then do B). Humans regularly and effotlessly deal with exceptions to rules and uncertainties without even realising; it is no surprise the rule-based systems of the time were struggling to progress. There was no shortage of suggestions for dealing with uncertainy, but it was Pearl's proposal that sparked the breakthrough.

Pearl's breakthrough was a prime example of how neuroscience can inspire AI. His eureka moment came whilst reading an article by David Rumelhart: a cognitive scientist at University of California, San Diego. The article highlighted, when humans read, we first recognise lines and circles which we combine to form letters; these combine to form words at the lexical level which are passed to the syntactic level. It is here, for example, that we decide to expect a noun to follow the word "the". Finally, we reach the semantic level, where we remember the previous sentence referenced a Volkswagen, so we predict the noun following "the" could be "car". Climbiing the ladder is permitted by information moving through layers of neurons in the brain.

All the while, information gets propogated down the neural ladder too. When we struggle to read poor handwriting, the syntactic and semantic levels provide context, which helps us recognise messy shapes, letters, and words. The key here is neurons in the brain are passing information in both directions (from the top down and the bottom up) and from side to side. A change in belief in one neuron has the ability to effect the state of all other neurons.

Pearl was convinced, for computers to reason well under uncertainty, they must adopt a structure similar to that of human neural information processing. Unlike the one way flow of "if A, then do B" statements in rule-based systems, messages must be passed in both directions across the network. It took Pearl a few months to figure out that these messages should consist of forward probabilities and inverse probabilities computed using Bayes' theorem. But, by the end of the 1980s, his students and colleagues had helped him create a tool that would accelerate the world of machine learning

in 2011, Pearl won the Turing Award - comp sci's Nobel Prizze- for his work on causal reasoning and AI.

## The Technology: Bayesian Networks

Bayesian networks, as used in Bonparte, are graphs that describe the qualitative relationship between variables with probabilities associated with edges to provide quantative answers. Continuing with the example above, the cognitive ability of our brain makes it straightforward to understand the ball hitting the window and the window smashing are associated.

Now, we can add more considerations. What if the window was double-glazed?

## Rough Notes

How much evidence would it take to convince us that something we consider improbable has actually happened? When does a hypothesis cross the line from impossibility to improbability and even to probability or virtual certainty? 

you can deduce the probability of a cause from an effect. If we know the cause, it is easy to estimate the probability of the effect, which is a forward probability. Going the other direction—a problem known in Bayes’s time as “inverse probability”—is harder.

If we observe a cause—for example, Bobby throws a ball toward a window—most of us can predict the effect (the ball will probably break the window). Human cognition works in this direction. But given the effect (the window is broken), we need much more information to deduce the cause (which boy threw the ball that broke it or even the fact that it was broken by a ball in the first place)

 Bayes set out to break this cognitive asymmetry 

we can estimate the conditional probability directly in one direction, for which our judgment is more reliable, and use mathematics to derive the conditional probability in the other direction, for which our judgment is rather hazy. in Bayesian networks; we tell the computer the forward probabilities, and the computer tells us the inverse probabilities when needed.

Bonparte works by converting pedigree trees into a Bayesian network. The mathematical framework of Bayesian networks was invented by Judea Pearl in the 1980s and named after Thomas Bayes.

## Reflection

I became captivated by the Malaysian Airways story whilst reading Judea Pearl's The Book of Why whilst backpacking Central America in 2022. 

 In fact, in the very first lecture of my master's, the lecturer presented Bayes' transcript; a delicate piece of paper that's been carefully preserved since the 1720s.

AI is not new. The news creates a false representation.
